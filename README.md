# Description
This is a project-based course from [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-with-pytorch--object-localization/home/)
 For localization task augmentation, we used albumentation library. We will load a pretrained state of the art convolutional neural network using timm library.Moreover, we are going to create train function and evaluate our function which will be helpful to write training loop.
